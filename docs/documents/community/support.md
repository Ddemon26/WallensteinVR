## FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: Is WallensteinVR ready for production use?**
A: WallensteinVR is currently in early development. It's great for learning and experimentation, but not recommended for production applications yet.

**Q: What VR headsets are supported?**
A: Any headset with OpenXR runtime support, including:
- Meta Quest (via Link/Air Link)
- HTC Vive series
- Valve Index
- Windows Mixed Reality headsets
- Pico headsets

**Q: Can I use this for commercial projects?**
A: Yes! WallensteinVR is MIT licensed, allowing commercial use. See LICENSE file for details.

### Technical Questions

**Q: Why Zig instead of C++ or Rust?**
A: Zig provides memory safety without garbage collection, excellent C interop, and compile-time guarantees that make it ideal for VR applications where performance and reliability are critical.

**Q: Can I contribute if I'm new to VR development?**
A: Absolutely! We welcome contributors of all skill levels. Check out our "good first issue" labels and don't hesitate to ask questions.

**Q: How do I test without VR hardware?**
A: Use Monado's null driver: `monado-service --verbose --null`. This simulates a VR environment for development and testing.

### Platform Questions

**Q: When will Windows support be available?**
A: Windows support is a high priority. We're looking for contributors to help with native Windows OpenXR/Vulkan integration.

**Q: What about macOS support?**
A: macOS support via MoltenVK is planned but lower priority due to limited VR ecosystem on macOS.

**Q: Can I run this in WSL2?**
A: WSL2 with GPU passthrough may work but isn't officially supported. Native Windows support is preferred.
